# Car Movement Visualization in Computer Graphics

This project demonstrates a simple car movement animation using OpenGL. The car moves across a predefined road with a starry sky backdrop, showcasing fundamental computer graphics techniques.

## Project Overview

The program initializes with a set of stars at random positions to simulate a night sky. A car is then rendered on a straight road, moving seamlessly from left to right. As the car moves, the stars in the background also shift to give an illusion of motion. The road is marked with lines to simulate a real-world scenario.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Background**: Stars are positioned randomly and move across the screen to simulate a night sky.
- **Car Animation**: A 2D car model moves from one side of the screen to the other, looping back to the start once it reaches the end.
- **Road Rendering**: A simple road with a lane divider is drawn to give context to the car's movement.

## Getting Started

To experience the car movement visualization, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the OpenGL library installed on your system.
2. Compile the provided C++ code using an appropriate compiler that supports OpenGL.
3. Run the executable to start the animation.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a basic illustration of moving objects in computer graphics. The principles demonstrated here can be extended to more complex animations and simulations.
